            <p class="text-muted"> Grace Church School is a private school whose original building is located at 86 Fourth Avenue between East 10th and East 12th Streets in the East Village neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The school was founded in 1894 by the Grace Church as the first choir boarding school in New York City.[4] The private day school, which much resembles the school today, began in 1934.[4] Grace Church School's High School Division opened in 2012 and is located at 46 Cooper Square. In the 2015â€“2016 school year, the school opened for the first time as a Junior Kindergarten through 12th grade program.[5][6]

                In 1947 Grace became a co-educational school and was admitted to the Guild of Independent Schools of New York City. In the following decade the school began to expand its facilities to accommodate a growing student body. From the original 16 choristers, Grace has grown to its current enrollment of more than 725 students drawn from a wide variety of ethnic, economic, and religious backgrounds.[7]
                
                While the school has continued its close relationship with Grace Church, since 1972 it has been governed by an independent Board of Trustees, and it is a fully accredited member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools and the National Association of Independent Schools. Grace Church School is also a member of the National Association of Episcopal Schools. In 2006, the School became a legal entity separate from the Church, and now owns the buildings at 84-96 Fourth Avenue, including the historic and landmarked church houses Clergy House, Memorial House and Neighborhood House.[8]
                
                In 2015, Grace Church School introduced "antiracist" language into its curriculums. Teachers of Grace Church School described "sustained pressure" to accept these changes, and the school later reprimanded a math teacher who criticized the initiative. In a private conversation, the school head conceded that Grace Church School demonized white students. Some students also echoed objections to the initiative.[9]
                
                The Grace Church School's high school building is located in Cooper Square. It was inaugurated in 2011.[6]</p>

                <p class="text-muted ">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology."[1] A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering."[2] School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."[3]

                    Researchers have demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist, scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted in Ohio[4] revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia in 2003.[5]</p>

        <p class="text-muted" >The King City High School Auditorium, also known as the Robert Stanton Theater, is an Art Moderne style auditorium in King City, California. Built in 1939 with Works Progress Administration funding, the auditorium is one of several buildings in the area in a similar style, known as WPA Moderne. It was designed by architect Robert Stanton of Carmel, in partnership with Joseph Jacinto Mora, who designed and executed the building's extensive sculptural elements.[2]</p>
